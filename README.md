# PolynomialRegression

Comparison between how well fitted the points get in a nonlinear relationship, using a linear regression and a polynomial regression.
To do this it was used the relation between fuel consumption and horsepower.
The dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. It was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition. (c) Date: July 7, 1993

## Dataset

"The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes." (Quinlan, 1993)

- Number of Instances: 398
- Number of Attributes: 9 including the class attribute

* Attribute Information:

- mpg: continuous
- cylinders: multi-valued discrete
- displacement: continuous
- horsepower: continuous
- weight: continuous
- acceleration: continuous
- model year: multi-valued discrete
- origin: multi-valued discrete
- car name: string (unique for each instance)
